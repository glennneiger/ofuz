	/**
	 * Rebuild the user contacts table
	 * User contacts are accessed from the tables by userid<iduser>_contact
  * The contact table is updated for all the contact related operation and also the user contact table is getting updated on
  * add/edit/delete operation of contact, tag etc.
  * To make it more reliable the following script is used. This is rebuilt all the user contact tables.
  * This script is intensive as the volume of contact and user increases.
  * Wise to set the script once in a week. Also we can ignore rebuiling of user contact tables who have not logged in in certain period by passing the parameter
  * in getUserLoggedInWithinPeriod() default is 7 days
  * @see class/Contact.class.php
  * @see class/ContactView.class.php
  *
