<textarea id="myTextarea" rows="10" cols="40">started looking at the same.
Phil suggested me to implement the some inline feature. 

Looked at the code and then had some confusion, discussed with Phil and he had given me some autoexpand sample as 
http://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-expandable


Started looking at the code in there ,looks like the .js downloadable file is not that heavy. 

But the site does not have any example on the implementation part.</textarea>
